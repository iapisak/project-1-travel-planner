## Introduction

Hello! Ever wanted to get out of the city? Maybe take a trip? 
Instead of writing it on paper why dont you store it on that iPhone already in your pocket. (Unless you're an android user.... please consult your nearest Apple store, family, and friends for the help you deserve)

This application was created in order to track a users vacation and share that that itinerey with any friends also going the trip.

We hope you enjoy it!
